  ENGL 235: Topics in Literature and New Media <br>
  UIUC Spring 2023<br>
  Theme: Writing with Robots<br>
  <br>
  In 2024, it can feel like Artificial Intelligence dominates the news. The release of ChatGPT in particular has sparked fears about how students will use or abuse AI writing tools in classes, and how professionals will make use to these tools their work. "Writing with Robots" addresses these controversies directly, first by introducing students to the long human history of seeking to simulate or automate intelligence and creativity. We will study historical automata and automated writing technologies, considering how technology has interplayed with writing over hundreds of years. We will read speculative fiction that seeks to probe the boundaries of human, non-human, and mechanical intelligence, considering how such literature might inform current debates. Finally, we will learn about and experiment with contemporary AI tools, seeking to understand their affordances and limitations and to construct a framework for productive, ethical engagement with this newest medium of automated writing.
