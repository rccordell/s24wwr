The assignments below are regular, low-stakes assignments you should expect to complete throughout the semester, in accordance with [your grading contract](syllabus/assessment).

# Assignment 1: Discussion Prep

## Assignment Overview

+ Weekly or twice weekly, depending on the number of reading discussion sessions scheduled
+ Students work individually
+ Posted to the discussion thread in Canvas for each class with assigned reading
+ Due prior to the beginning of the pertinent class period

## Details

For each discussion session in this class, you will be assigned articles or books to read, files to watch, websites to browse, etc. In order to help you attend closely to our course texts and prepare for our discussions, you should prepare 3 questions or observations prior to each discussion session on the class syllabus (i.e. for each day with assigned reading). This means three questions/observations in total, **not** three per reading.

These responses will serve as prompts for our conversations together and demonstrate your initial engagement with the ideas of our class. I will create a thread on Canvas for each discussion class period, and your prep should be posted there before a given session starts. In order for your questions/observations to be “Satisfactory,” they should, in general:

1.  Get beyond basic questions or observations of fact and instead work toward questions or observations of significance.
2.  Demonstrate close thought about the themes, style, arguments and other elements of our texts, as well as about the relationships among them.
3.  Emerge from (and refer to) specific ideas, pages, quotations, scenes, &c. from our assigned texts rather than broad or generic concepts.
4.  Genuinely open toward discussion and debate during class (i.e. no leading the witness, your honor).

Discussion prep will be deemed “Unsatisfactory” when it indicates lack of preparation or inattentive reading, and will have consequences as outlined in your grading contract.

# Assignment 2: Critical Reflections

## Assignment Overview

+ Short, critical reflections of around 500 words 
+ Written in response to prompts added to course Canvas during the semester
+ Students work individually
+ In general, due within two weeks of a prompt being posted
+ Students will submit the number of responses outlined in their grade contracts

## Details

"Writing with Robots" moves between discussion of media (e.g. readings, videos, webpages) and applied activities. In order to help you synthesize work across these activities, as well as reflect on the larger themes raised throughout the semester, you will write longer-form, analytical posts in response to prompts. I will post ~10 prompts over the course of the semester, and students will respond based on their course contracts. Critical reflections are generally due 2 weeks after a prompt is posted, so you want to check for prompts on Canvas regularly.

Your critical reflections should aim for more substance and detail than your class prep posts, but they are not full-fledged academic essays. Think instead of smart, critical writing you might encounter online: a blog entry or a sharp opinion piece. Formally, that translates to 400-500 words, or 4-5 paragraphs. Your reflective posts should synthesize and bring readings into conversation, and should focus on developing an argument around a few core ideas. These posts should cite our media and discussions directly and include a (likely brief) works cited. You should not spend words summarizing readings or recounting discussions from class, but instead choosing details that help illustrate your own ideas.

## Flexibility

This is a challenging and full class. To give you some flexibility, you may choose to forgo responding to reflective prompts a few times during the semester, in line with your chosen grading contract. I strongly recommend you not delay starting this work, but instead begin early and work steadily so that you can use this flexibility as the inevitable stresses of the semester emerge. It’s generally much easier, in other words, to respond to all the prompts early in the semester, so you can ignore the last ones, rather than putting yourself in a situation where you can only fulfill your contract by responding to every prompt remaining (or are having to write me requesting to submit late work).

# Assignment 3: In-class Work

"Writing with Robots" will include regular activities, both individual and collaborative, that ask you to engage with our assigned media or experiment with specific technologies. The output of these activities will vary, but sometimes you will be asked to submit a brief written report or reflection, or another artifact, demonstrating your thinking.
