## Assignment Overview

"Writing with Robots" will include regular activities, both individual and collaborative, that ask you to engage with our assigned media or experiment with specific technologies. The output of these activities will vary, but sometimes you will be asked to submit a brief written report or reflection, or another artifact, demonstrating your thinking.
